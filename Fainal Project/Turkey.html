        <h1>Fairy chimneys in Goreme</h1>
        <p>Cappadocia is famous for its wonderfully strange rock formations and its distinguished archaeological history. One of the best places to see these strange formations is the village of Goreme. The village is located in the middle of large numbers of conical porous stone known as “fairy chimneys” that were formed by wind and water erosion of two volcanic layers: a thick layer of porous stone covered with a thin layer of basalt that resists erosion. Many of these chimneys in Cappadocia were hollowed out over the centuries to create homes, churches, and storage facilities due to the ease of carving in the porous stone.</p>
