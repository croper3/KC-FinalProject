        <h1>Greco-Persian Wars</h1>
        <p>The Greco-Persian Wars (Persian: nghai, Iran and Greece) were a series of wars between the Achaemenid Empire and the Greek states that began in 499 BC and ended in 449 BC. The conflict between the Greeks and the Persians began when Cyrus the Great occupied the Greek region of Ionia in 547 BC. The Persians struggled to control the independent population of Ionia, so they appointed several tyrants to rule the cities in the region, which posed many problems for the Greeks and the Persians alike.</p>
